## Overview of images and videos

### Images

Images in your documentation are added using standard Markdown syntax. All image files must be stored in the `/public` directory of your project.

#### Basic Image Syntax

![Devscribe logo](/devscribe-logo.png)

<CodeSnippet language="markdown" title="Syntax">
![Alt text](/image-filename.png)
</CodeSnippet>

#### Image with Title

Add a title attribute for additional context on hover:

![Devscribe logo](/devscribe-logo.png "Devscribe Logo")

<CodeSnippet language="markdown" title="With Title">
![Alt text](/image-filename.png "Title text")
</CodeSnippet>

#### Adding Images to Your Project

**Step 1: Place image in public directory**

Store your image file in the `/public` folder at the root of your project:

<CodeSnippet language="text">
{`/public
  ├── your-image.png
  ├── screenshots/
  │   └── feature-screenshot.png
  └── logos/
      └── company-logo.svg`}
</CodeSnippet>

**Step 2: Reference image in markdown**

Use the file path relative to the public directory, starting with `/`:

<CodeSnippet language="markdown">
{`![Feature screenshot](/screenshots/feature-screenshot.png)
![Company logo](/logos/company-logo.svg)`}
</CodeSnippet>

<Callout type="info">
The `/public` directory is the root for all static assets. When referencing images, always start paths with `/` to indicate they're in the public directory.
</Callout>

#### Remote Images

Remote images from external URLs require whitelisting in your Next.js configuration:

<CodeSnippet language="typescript" title="next.config.ts" showLineNumbers={true}>
{`const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: 'images.unsplash.com',
      },
    ],
  },
};`}
</CodeSnippet>

After configuration, referenceexternal images directly:

<CodeSnippet language="markdown">
![External image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-example.jpg)
</CodeSnippet>

<Callout type="warning">
Only add trusted domains to your remote patterns. Each external domain must be explicitly whitelisted for security.
</Callout>

#### Supported Image Formats

The following image formats are supported:

- **PNG** - `.png`
- **JPG/JPEG** - `.jpg`, `.jpeg`
- **SVG** - `.svg`
- **GIF** - `.gif`
- **WebP** - `.webp`

#### Image Best Practices

<Callout type="tip">
**File Size:** Optimize images before uploading. Keep file sizes under 500KB when possible for faster page loads.

**Alt Text:** Always include descriptive alt text for accessibility and SEO. Describe what the image shows.

**File Names:** Use lowercase, hyphenated filenames: `my-screenshot.png` instead of `My Screenshot.png`.

**Organization:** Create subdirectories in `/public` to organize images by category or page.
</Callout>

### Videos

<Callout type="warning">
Native video component support is not yet available. Use one of the workarounds below to include videos in your documentation.
</Callout>

#### Video Workaround Options

**Option 1: Embedded Video Players**

Use embedded video players from hosting platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, or Loom.

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeSnippet language="html" title="YouTube">
    {`<iframe width="560" height="315" 
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID" 
  frameborder="0" 
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
  allowfullscreen>
</iframe>`}
  </CodeSnippet>
  
  <CodeSnippet language="html" title="Vimeo">
    {`<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/VIDEO_ID" 
  width="640" height="360" 
  frameborder="0" 
  allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" 
  allowfullscreen>
</iframe>`}
  </CodeSnippet>
</CodeGroup>

**Option 2: GIF Animations**

Convert short video clips to GIF format and include them as images:

<CodeSnippet language="markdown">
![Demo walkthrough](/demos/feature-demo.gif)
</CodeSnippet>

<Callout type="info">
This approach works well for short demonstrations (under 10 seconds).
</Callout>

**Option 3: Video Links**

Link to videos hosted externally:

<CodeSnippet language="markdown">
[Watch the tutorial video](https://youtu.be/example-video)
</CodeSnippet>

### Upcoming Features

<Callout type="tip">
The following features are planned for future releases:
- **Drag-and-drop asset upload** - Upload images directly from the web editor by dragging files into the file tree
- **Native video component** - Dedicated component for self-hosted videos
- **Image optimization** - Automatic image compression and responsive sizing
- **Card image support** - Display images directly in Card components
</Callout>

### Troubleshooting

**Image not displaying**

Check these common issues:

- Verify the image file exists in `/public`
- Ensure the path starts with `/` (e.g., `/image.png` not `image.png`)
- Check for typos in the filename (remember: filenames are case-sensitive)
- Confirm the file extension matches the actual file type

Correct path structure:

<CodeSnippet language="text">
/public/screenshots/demo.png → ![Demo](/screenshots/demo.png)
</CodeSnippet>

**Remote image blocked**

If a remote image isn't loading, add its domain to `next.config.ts`:

<CodeSnippet language="typescript" title="next.config.ts">
{`const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: 'your-image-domain.com',
      },
    ],
  },
};`}
</CodeSnippet>

<Callout type="warning">
After configuration changes, restart your development server.
</Callout>

**Image appears too large**

Standard Markdown images display at their native size. To control image dimensions, use HTML:

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeSnippet language="html" title="Width Control">
    <img src="/large-image.png" alt="Description" width="600" />
  </CodeSnippet>
  
  <CodeSnippet language="html" title="Responsive">
    <img src="/large-image.png" alt="Description" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
  </CodeSnippet>
</CodeGroup>

### Examples

#### Documentation with Screenshots

**Step 1: Navigate to Settings**

Open your project dashboard and click the Settings icon in the sidebar.

![Settings menu location](/screenshots/settings-menu.png "Location of settings menu")

**Step 2: Configure API Keys**

In the API section, click "Generate New Key" to create an API key.

![API key generation](/screenshots/api-keys.png)

**Step 3: Copy and Save**

Copy your API key and store it securely. You won't be able to view it again.

<Callout type="danger">
Never commit API keys to version control or share them publicly.
</Callout>
